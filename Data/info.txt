4. Relevant Information:
   -- A simple database containing 17 Boolean-valued attributes.  The "type"
      attribute appears to be the class attribute.  Here is a breakdown of
      which animals are in which type: (I find it unusual that there are
      2 instances of "frog" and one of "girl"!)
